Sure, here's a README file for the Python program you created.

# üìÑ File Processor with Error Handling

This Python program is a simple yet robust utility designed to demonstrate file reading, content modification, and writing to a new file, all while implementing comprehensive error handling for common file-related issues.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **File Reading**: Reads the entire content of a user-specified input file.
  * **Content Modification**: Transforms the read content (e.g., converts text to uppercase and adds a custom header/footer).
  * **File Writing**: Writes the modified content to a new, user-specified output file.
  * **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully manages exceptions such as `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and general `IOError` during file operations.
  * **User-Friendly Prompts**: Provides clear messages and allows users to retry operations in case of errors.

-----

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Save the Code**: Save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `file_processor.py`).

2.  **Open a Terminal**: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file using your terminal or command prompt.

3.  **Execute the Script**: Run the script using the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python file_processor.py
    ```

4.  **Follow Prompts**: The program will ask you to enter an **input filename** and an **output filename**.

      * **Example Input**: If you have a file named `my_document.txt` in the same directory, you would type `my_document.txt` when prompted for the input file.
      * **Example Output**: You might type `modified_document.txt` for the output file.

## üß™ Example Usage

Let's assume you have an `input.txt` file with the following content:

```
Hello, G-Link team!
This is a test file for the Python script.
We are learning about file operations.
```

1.  When you run the script, it will prompt:
    ```
    Welcome to the File Processor!
    Please enter the name of the input file (e.g., input.txt): input.txt
    Please enter the name for the output file (e.g., output.txt): output.txt
    ```
2.  Upon successful execution, you will see output in the terminal showing the original and modified content.
3.  A new file named `output.txt` will be created (or overwritten) in the same directory, containing:
    ```
    --- MODIFIED BY PYTHON SCRIPT ---

    HELLO, G-LINK TEAM!
    THIS IS A TEST FILE FOR THE PYTHON SCRIPT.
    WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT FILE OPERATIONS.

    --- END MODIFICATION ---
    ```

## üö¶ Error Handling in Action

The program is designed to guide you through errors:

  * **`FileNotFoundError`**: If you enter an input filename that doesn't exist:

    ```
    Please enter the name of the input file (e.g., input.txt): non_existent_file.txt
    Please enter the name for the output file (e.g., output.txt): output.txt

    Error: The file 'non_existent_file.txt' was not found.
    Please ensure the file exists in the correct directory and try again.

    Attempt complete. If there was an error, please try again.
    ```

    The program will then prompt you to enter the filenames again.

  * **`PermissionError`**: If you try to write to a protected location (e.g., a system folder without admin rights), or if the input file has restrictive permissions, you'll receive a `PermissionError` message and an opportunity to retry.

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure

The core logic resides within the `process_file_with_error_handling()` function.

  * A `while True` loop allows for repeated attempts until successful processing.
  * A `try...except` block encapsulates file operations, catching specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundError` and `PermissionError`, and a general `IOError` and `Exception` for broader coverage.
  * The `finally` block ensures a consistent "Attempt complete" message is printed after each operation attempt.

-----

## üí° Customization

  * **Modification Logic**: You can easily change the content modification logic inside the `process_file_with_error_handling()` function. For example, instead of converting to uppercase, you could:

      * Reverse the text.
      * Add line numbers.
      * Filter specific words.
      * Perform text substitutions.

  * **Error Messages**: Customize the error messages to be more specific or helpful for your use case.
